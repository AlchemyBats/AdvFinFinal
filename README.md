# AdvFinFinal
Final project for Advanced Financial Modeling

1) download files and open in visual studio code
2) use pip install in terminal on any modules not installed
3) run the code. You will need to log into wrds the first time it runs to get the data
4) wait for the data to load. If it is your first time running the project, it may take a few minutes
5) Open the dash app when prompted
6) Change the sector and tickers to see market insights


Update:
I forgot to mention in my video walkthrough that I now use Dash instead of Streamlit like I mentioned in the proposal. This is because at the time of the proposal, I had not used any UI systems before and selected one arbitrarily, but because I used Dash in both my group project and one of my earlier weekly excersizes, I was more comfortable using it.
